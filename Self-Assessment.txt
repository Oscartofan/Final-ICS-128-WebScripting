                    Self-Assessment 

1. Script Placement: Where to place your JavaScript code (there is more than one place) 
and when it is appropriate to place it one place or another.

- under the <script></script> code with the correct src of the java file. thta was initialize 
first in the (head)
- inside the java file.

2. DOM Element Targeting

- document.querySelector(#THEID).innerHTML (get need to put the same ID and.... magic!)
works exaclty the same as targeting labels with css
-I know there another one but with classes

3. Number formatting
How to convert strings to numbers (integers and floats) and how to format them appropriately.

- This is the way I do based in lectures, I use parseInt() or when I know I have a variable that is and integer I do (+=) to the variable I want to convert.

4. UI / UX
How to build superior experience to your page using JavaScript and other frameworks (such as Bootstrap).


So far I know more of css (bootstrap) than JS so...
to build a really nice webpage in my opinion we need to have every part of the web in sections, (Showcase, hero, Navbar, buttons, IMG with correct scaling... etc etc)
and the most important thing ALWAYS MOBILE!
